11. Protecting Arguments from Expansion
	The backslash (\) is an escape character in the Bash shell.

	Note: single qute and double qute
			Single quotation marks stop all shell expansion. Double quotation marks stop most shell expansion.
	If we use single qutation, it will consider everything as string, all variables in single quation also remain string
	If we use double qutation, all the variable will be used as variable

	echo "Will variable $myhost evaluate to $(hostname -s)?"
		Will variable host evaluate to host?
	echo 'Will variable $myhost evaluate to $(hostname -s)?'
		Will variable $myhost evaluate to $(hostname -s)?

	Backticks (`...`) = Old style command substitution.  # echo "Files: `ls \`pwd\``"
	$(...) = Modern, recommended style. # echo "Files: $(ls $(pwd))"
